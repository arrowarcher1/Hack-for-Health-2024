# Hack-for-Health-2024

Developed a predictive model that assesses lung cancer risk. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques with Google Cloud's Vertex AI and AutoML, our team trained a tabular analysis model capable of providing a preliminary risk rating based on a user's medical history and other significant factors.

Achievements:

Innovative Solution: Designed a user-friendly, cost-effective pre-screening process that democratizes access to early lung cancer detection, especially benefiting individuals in lower-income communities.

Technical Excellence: Successfully harnessed the power of cloud computing and machine learning to process and analyze data, ensuring accurate risk assessments with minimal input requirements.

Social Impact: Addressed a critical gap in the healthcare system by providing a scalable solution that could significantly reduce the barriers to early lung cancer detection, potentially saving lives through early intervention.

Award-Winning: Our project was honored with the "Best First Year Solution" award, recognizing our innovative approach, technical proficiency, and potential impact on public health.

Future Vision: Eager to continue the project with a larger dataset, as well as more model training time to allow for a faster and more accurate prediction. Plan to continue to improve the front-end user experience, as well as automate some of the inputs such as air quality in the users location.

Technologies Used: Google Cloud AutoML, Google Cloud Compute, Vertex AI - Tabular Analysis, Python

Project Reflection:
This project was not only a technical challenge for us but truly an opportunity to make a tangible difference in people's lives. This project continues to show the possibilities for technology to bridge significant gaps that have been defining our world for too long, especially in the health sector.
